## 🚀 Features

- **🌌 Interactive 3D Background:** A mesmerizing, animated background built with Three.js.
- **💎 Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern "frosted glass" interface for all UI elements.

- **✨ Minimalist Interface:** A clean, unobtrusive UI that prioritizes the content.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project uses the GitHub API to fetch the contents of the `/saves` directory in this repository. The JavaScript then dynamically generates a "card" for each `.zip` file it finds, creating a direct download link. This means that whenever you push a new save file to the `saves` folder, the website updates automatically.

## 📂 How to Use

1.  **Add your save file:** Place your game save (in `.zip` format) into the `/saves` directory in your local repository.
2.  **Commit and push:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new game save"
    git push
    ```
3.  **Done!** The new save file will now appear on the website.
